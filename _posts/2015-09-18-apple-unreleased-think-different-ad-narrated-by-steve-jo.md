description: "When developing the Think Different ad campaign, Lee Clow from Apple's agency TBWA\\Chiat\\Day asked Steve Jobs to narrate the ad. Steve was reluctant initially because he didn't want people that viewed the ad to relate to him, but the Apple. He finally obliged but in the end, Apple choose to use Richard Dreyfus' voice."
